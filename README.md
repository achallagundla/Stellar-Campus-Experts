# Stellar-Campus-Experts
Stellar Campus Experts Playbook

This is a community initiative by the Stellar Development Foundation to advocate and build the campus Blockchain Developer community. We want those within the campus ecosystem who are seeking to be the leaders of blockchain accessibility and inclusion.

At the Stellar Development Foundation, we work to increase equitable access to the world’s financial infrastructure.

We want to empower the builders, and innovators who create apps and services on the Stellar network. We believe campus ecosystems can benefit from the opportunities in blockchain technology and hands-on involvement from participating in the Stellar Campus Experts program.

# Who are Stellar Campus Experts?
The Stellar Campus Experts are passionate about sharing blockchain development- and SDF-related knowledge (no prior SDF knowledge required, we will train them) however, we do expect them to have some prior technical skills.

# What do Campus Experts do? 
- Inspire your community
- Host meetups and run workshops
- Write blog posts (content launchpad)

After completing these three steps, they can host workshops, create content, and get involved with Stellar Campus Expert events.
